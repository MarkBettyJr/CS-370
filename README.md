-Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
        The work I completed on the final project for this class was the loop for the Q-Learning algorithm. I was provided the code that created the neural network, the code that creates the maze and the basic gameplay.

-Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
        What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
                Computer Scientists design, develop, and analyze teh software and hardware used to solve problems. This relates to the material in this course as computer scientists develop code used in neural networks, Machine Leaning, and Artificial Intelligence Algorithms. 
        How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
                I would approach a problem as a computer scientist by clearly defining the problem statement. Identifing who the vested parties are, what they want or need to solve the problem. Identify if a satisfactory solution exists for thier problem, if not not I would put together a team to develop a solution to solve the problem.
        What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
                My ethical responsibilities the teh end user and the organization would be to evaluate my work and the work I am apart of to ensure it is in compliance with all current regulations internal to my company, as well as any local/ state/ federal/ or international laws as well as industry best practices. I have a moral responsibility to my self and those who trust me to always perform in a professional manner. A way this is expected of me by my peers, organization, and any users of my professional outputs.
